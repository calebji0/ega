\subsection{Preschemes integral over another prescheme}
\label{subsection:II.6.1}

\begin{definition}[6.1.1]
\label{II.6.1.1}
Let $X$ be an $S$-prescheme, with structure morphism $f:X\to S$.
We say that $X$ is \emph{integral over $S$}, or that $f$ is an \emph{integral morphism}, if there exists a cover $(S_\alpha)$ of $S$ by affine opens such that, for all $\alpha$, the induced prescheme $f^{-1}(S_\alpha)$ is an affine scheme whose ring $B_\alpha$ is an integral algebra over the ring $A_\alpha$ of $S_\alpha$.
We say that $X$ is \emph{finite over $S$}, or that $f$ is a \emph{finite morphism} if $X$ is integral and of finite type over $S$.
\end{definition}

If $S$ is affine of ring $A$, then we also say ``integral (resp. finite) over $A$'' instead of ``integral (resp. finite) over $S$''.

\begin{env}[6.1.2]
\label{II.6.1.2}
It is clear that, if $X$ is integral over $S$, then it is \emph{affine} over $S$.
For an affine prescheme $X$ over $S$ to be integral (resp. finite) over $S$ it is necessary and sufficient that the associated quasi-coherent $\sh{O}_S$-algebra $\sh{A}(X)$ be such that there exist a cover $(S_\alpha)$ of $S$ by affine opens having the property that, for all $\alpha$, $\Gamma(S_\alpha,\sh{A}(X))$ is an integral (resp. integral and of finite type) algebra over $\Gamma(S_\alpha,\sh{O}_S)$.
A quasi-coherent $\sh{O}_S$-algebra with this property is said to be \emph{integral} (resp. \emph{finite}) over $\sh{O}_S$.
Giving an integral (resp. finite) prescheme over $S$ is thus \sref{II.1.3.1} the same as giving a quasi-coherent $\sh{O}_S$-algebra that is integral (resp. finite) over $\sh{O}_S$.
Note that a quasi-coherent $\sh{O}_S$-algebra $\sh{B}$ is finite if and only if it is an \emph{$\sh{O}_S$-module of finite type} \sref[I]{I.1.3.9};
it is equivalent to say that $\sh{B}$ is an \emph{integral} $\sh{O}_S$-algebra \emph{of finite type}, since an algebra that is integral and of finite type over a ring $A$ is an $A$-module of finite type.
\end{env}

\begin{proposition}[6.1.3]
\label{II.6.1.3}
Let $S$ be a locally Noetherian prescheme.
For an affine prescheme $X$ over $S$ to be finite over $S$, it is necessary and sufficient that the $\sh{O}_S$-algebra $\sh{A}(X)$ be coherent.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Taking the preceding remark into account, this reduces to noting that, if $S$ is locally Noetherian, then the quasi-coherent $\sh{O}_S$-modules of finite type are exactly the coherent $\sh{O}_S$-modules \sref[I]{I.1.5.1}.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}[6.1.4]
\label{II.6.1.4}
Let $X$ be an integral (resp. finite) prescheme over $S$, with structure morphism $f:X\to S$.
Then, for every affine open $U\subset S$ of ring $A$, $f^{-1}(U)$ is an affine scheme whose ring $B$ is an integral (resp. finite) algebra over $A$.
\end{proposition}

\oldpage[II]{111}
\begin{proof}
We first prove the following lemma:

  \begin{lemma}[6.1.4.1]
  \label{II.6.1.4.1}
  Let $A$ be a ring, $M$ an $A$-module, and $(g_i)_{1\leq i\leq m}$ a finite system of elements of $A$ such that the $D(g_i)$ (for $1\leq i\leq m$) cover $\Spec(A)$.
  If, for all $i$, $M_{g_i}$ is an $A_{g_i}$-module of finite type, then $M$ is an $A$-module of finite type.
  \end{lemma}

  \begin{proof}
  We can assume that $M_{g_i}$ admits a finite system of generators $(m_{ij}/g_i^n)$ with $m_{ij}\in M$, with $n$ the same for all indices $i$.
  We will show that the $m_{ij}$ for a system of generators of $M$.
  By hypothesis, for each $i$, there exist $a_{ij}\in A$ and some integer $p$ (independent of $i$) such that, in $M_{g_i}$, $m/1=(\sum_i a_{ij}m_{ij})/g_i^p$;
  this implies that there exists an integer $r\geq p$ such that, for all $i$, we have $g_i^rm\in M'$.
  But, since the $D(g_i^r)=D(g_i)$ cover $\Spec(A)$, the ideal of $A$ generated by the $g_i^r$ is equal to $A$, or, in other words, there exist elements $a_i\in A$ such that $\sum_i a_ig_i^r$;
  then $m=(\sum_i a_i g_i^r)m\in M'$, whence the lemma.
  \end{proof}

Now we already know \sref{II.1.3.2} that $f^{-1}(U)$ is affine.
If $\vphi$ is the homomorphism $A\to B$ corresponding to $f$, then there exists a finite cover of $U$ by opens $D(g_i)$ (where $g_i\in A$) such that, if $h_i=\vphi(g_i)$, $B_{h_i}$ is an integral (resp. integral and finite) algebra over $A_{g_i}$.
Indeed, there exists a cover of $U$ by affine opens $V_\alpha\subset U$ such that, if $A_\alpha=A(V_\alpha)$, $B_\alpha=A(f^{-1}(V_\alpha))$ is an integral (resp. finite) algebra over $A_\alpha$.
Every $x\in U$ belongs to some $V_\alpha$, so there exists $g\in A$ such that $x\in D(g)\subset V_\alpha$;
if $g_\alpha$ is the image of $g$ in $A_\alpha$, then $A(D(g))=A_g=(A_\alpha)_{g_\alpha}$;
let $h=\vphi(g)$, and let $h_\alpha$ be the image of $g_\alpha$ in $B_\alpha$;
we have
\[
  A(D(h)) = B_h = (B_\alpha)_{h_\alpha}
\]
and, since $B_\alpha$ is integral (resp. finite) over $A_\alpha$, $(B_\alpha)_{h_\alpha}$ is integral (resp. finite) over $(A_\alpha)_{g_\alpha}$.
It now suffices to use the fact that $U$ is quasi-compact to obtain the desired cover.

If we suppose first of all that the $B_{h_i}$ are integral and finite over the $A_{g_i}$, then since $B_{h_i}$ can also be written as $B_{g_i}$ as an $A_{g_i}$-module, Lemma~\sref{II.6.1.4.1} shows that, in this case, $B$ is an $A$-module of finite type.

Now suppose only that each $B_{h_i}$ is integral over $A_{g_i}$;
let $b\in B$, and let $C$ be the sub-$A$-algebra of $B$ generated by $b$.
For all $i$, $C_{h_i}$ is the algebra over $A_{g_i}$ generated by $b/1$ in $B_{h_i}$;
it follows from the hypothesis that each $C_{h_i}$ is an $A_{g_i}$-module of finite type, and so \sref{II.6.1.4.1} $C$ is an $A$-module of finite type, which proves that $B$ is integral over $A$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}[6.1.5]
\label{II.6.1.5}
\medskip\noindent
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(i)] A closed immersion is finite (and \emph{a fortiori} integral).
  \item[(ii)] The composition of two finite (resp. integral) morphisms is finite (resp. integral).
  \item[(iii)] If $f:X\to Y$ is a finite (resp. integral) $S$-morphism, then $f_{(S')}:X_{(S')}\to Y_{(S')}$ is finite (resp. integral) for any base extension $S'\to S$.
  \item[(iv)] If $f:X\to Y$ and $g:X'\to Y'$ are finite (resp. integral) $S$-morphisms, then $f\times_S g:X\times_S Y\to X'\times_S Y'$ is finite (resp. integral).
  \item[(v)] If $f:X\to Y$ and $g:Y\to Z$ are morphisms such that $g\circ f$ is finite (resp. integral), if $g$ is separated, then $f$ is finite (resp. integral).
  \item[(vi)] If $f:X\to Y$ is a finite (resp. integral) morphism, then $f_\red$ is finite (resp. integral).
