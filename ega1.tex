In \textsection\textsection1--8 we do little more than develop a language to be used in what follows.
It should be noted, however, that, in accordance with the general spirit of this treatise, \textsection\textsection7--8 will be used less than the others, and in a less essential way; we speak of Chevalley schemes only for the purpose of relating to the language of Chevalley \cite{I-1} and Nagata \cite{I-9}.
Then, in \textsection9, we give definitions and results concerning quasi-coherent sheaves, some of which are no longer simply a translation of known notions of commutative algebra into a ``geometric'' language, but are instead already of a global nature; they will be indispensable, in the following chapters, when it comes to the global study of morphisms.
Finally, in \textsection10, we introduce a generalization of the notion of a scheme, which will be used as an intermediary in Chapter~III to conveniently formulate and prove the fundamental results of the cohomological study of proper morphisms;
moreover, it should be noted that the notion of formal schemes seems indispensable in expressing certain facts about the ``theory of modules'' (classification problems of algebraic varieties).
The results of \textsection10 will not be used before \textsection3 of Chapter~III, and it is recommended to skip their reading until then.
